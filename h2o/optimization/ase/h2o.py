# Structure optimization of water molecule with NWChem and ASE
# This script uses ASE to optimize the geometry of a water molecule (H2O)
# using the NWChem calculator. It sets up the water molecule with
# specified bond length and angle, performs the optimization,
# and writes the optimized structure to an XYZ file.
# The script also calculates the potential energy of the optimized structure.
# The script uses the BFGS algorithm for optimization and sets a force
# convergence criterion of 0.02 eV/Ã….
# The script requires the ASE package and NWChem to be installed and properly configured.
# The script assumes that NWChem is available in the system path.
# The script uses the PBE functional for the calculation.
# The script uses the ASE Atoms class to create the water molecule
# and the ASE BFGS class for optimization

# The script uses the ASE NWChem calculator to perform the calculation. 
# The script uses the ASE numpy module to perform numerical calculations.
# The script uses the ASE io module to write the optimized structure to an XYZ file.
# The script uses the ASE optimize module to perform the optimization.
# The script uses the ASE calculators module to perform the calculation.
# The script uses the ASE atoms module to create the water molecule.
